                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9×13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.            </li>

                Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add ground beef and onion and cook until beef has browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Drain excess fat. Stir in tomatoes and Italian seasoning until well combined.
